# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Overview
This project was undertaken to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Pewlett Hackard is trying to figure out if they can initiate a mentorship program based on elligible retiring employees that will train and provide a learning framework for new employees.

This is the ERD outline for the database for the project

The following image represents the job type as well as the amount of employees representing their respective titles who are elligible for retirment. We can see that the number of employees retiring are many (90,398) The total employees for the company are 300024. The amount of retiring employees relative to the total is 90,398/300024 = roughly 31 percent of the total workforce. The staff with titles of "senior" would be suitable for the mentorship program as can be depicted below but do not necessarily make up those eligible for the mentorship program.

The total count of the mentorship eligible is 1940 based on the chart and csv data:

This implies that if 31% of the workforce is retiring i.e 90,398 leaving 209,626 employees, Pewlet Hackard will have roughly 1940/ 209,626 = 0.92% of the current workforce as mentorship eligibile. 

### SUMMARY

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
The amount of roles needed to be filled are based on those leaving the company. If we assume those whom are retirement eligible will all leave, and those who are mentorship eligible will stay and help, Then we have 90,398 (retirement eligible) leaving the company leaving 209,626 employees. That leaves 90,398 roles to be filled with only 1940 mentors.
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
With 90,398 employees leaving and only 1940 mentors, that leaves roughly a 1:46 ratio more or less of the amount of mentors overseeing different employees, i.e one mentor for every 46 new employees. Given these numbers, the argument can be made that because a large majority of employees that are retiring are "senior" (37,4672) Pewlett Hackard might not have enough qualified mentors to help the next generation of employees.
